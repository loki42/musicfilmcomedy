musicfilmcomedy
===============

The source code for www.musicfilmcomedy.com It uses cherrypy, mako, retools, redis, varnish, GeoIP, postgresql, facebook comments and few other things. Hopefully a decent example of a web app coded using these tools. 

It can run with the cherrypy server or any other wsgi server. I've tested it with uwsgi. Look in simple_benchmark.txt to see the ways of starting it. 

The app is machine translated using bing translate and babel. I'll split that section out into a seperate repo soon.
